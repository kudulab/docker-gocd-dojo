# GoCD development environment in docker

This is development environment for [GoCD](https://github.com/gocd/gocd) built using
[Dojo](https://github.com/ai-traders/dojo) and [official scripts](https://github.com/gocd-contrib/gocd-oss-cookbooks)
used by the CI agents at https://build.gocd.org

This image allows to build and test GoCD. It can be used to **build your fork or locally test a PR**.

# Usage

1. [Install docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/), if you haven't already.
2. Install [Dojo](https://github.com/kudulab/dojo#installation), it is a self-contained binary, so just place it somewhere on the `PATH`. On OSX you can use `brew install kudulab/homebrew-dojo-osx/dojo`.

3. Checkout and `cd` into gocd project directory, then start docker container:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/gocd/gocd.git
cd gocd
dojo
```
This will enter a docker container with all tools needed for building GoCD. Your local copy of gocd is in current directory `/dojo/work`.

In order to build GoCD, you can use `./gradlew`. For example, to build debian packages and generic zip distribution:
```bash
./gradlew clean serverPackageDeb agentPackageDeb agentGenericZip versionFile
```
You will find the artifacts in `installers/target/distributions`.

 * For more details about building GoCD please refer to the [developer documentation](https://developer.gocd.org/current/)
 * For more details about using Dojo see the [readme](https://github.com/ai-traders/dojo)
